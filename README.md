A sleek and responsive One-Time Password (OTP) input interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This UI provides an intuitive and visually appealing way to enter OTP codes, commonly used in authentication systems. With smooth focus transitions and validation feedback, this project is a perfect starting point for implementing OTP input fields in web applications.

## Key Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Supports numeric input and backspace for corrections.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Validation Feedback**: Displays visual feedback for valid input fields.
- **Pure UI Implementation**: Note: This project is a frontend-only UI without backend authentication or verification.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Manages focus transitions and user interactions.
